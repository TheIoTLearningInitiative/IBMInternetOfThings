# Arquitecture

## Watson Natural Language Processing

> Automatically link words to the user’s meaning and intent and correlate with other sources of data to put interactions into context of specific solutions. Uses:
> > Natural Language Classifier
> > Concept Expansion
> > Conversation
> > Dialog
> > Language Translation
> > Text to Speech
> > Speech to Text

## Watson Machine Learning

> Automate data processing and rank data based on learned priorities. Machine Learning can be applied to IoT data to automatically understand current conditions, expected trends and suggested actions when issues arise. Uses:
> > Watson Analytics
> > Tradeoff Analytics
> > Apache Spark machine learning library

## Watson Video and Image Analytics

> Monitor unstructured data from video feeds and image snapshots to identify scenes and patterns in video data. Apps can combine this data with machine data to gain a greater understanding of past events and emerging situations. Uses:
> > AlchemyVision
> > Visual Recognition

## Watson Text Analytics

> Mine unstructured textual data, including transcripts from call centers, technician maintenance logs and blog comments to find correlations and patterns in the vast amounts of data from these sources. Uses:
> > AlchemyLanguage
