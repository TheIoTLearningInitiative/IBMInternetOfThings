## Internet of Things Foundation

> Internet of Things Foundation is a fully managed, cloud-hosted service that makes it simple to derive value from Internet of Things (IoT) devices

> Internet of Things Foundation allows you to easily compose IoT solutions

> The IBM Internet of Things service lets your apps communicate with and consume data collected by your connected devices, sensors, and gateways. Our recipes make it super easy to get devices connected to our Internet of Things cloud. Your apps can then use our real-time and REST APIs to communicate with your devices and consume the data you've set them up to collect.

## IoT Real-Time Insights

> The IBM IoT Real-Time Insights services allows you to understand IoT data in context and monitor the conditions of your devices and operations. IoT Real-Time Insights works with Internet of Things Foundation to enrich and monitor data from you devices, visualize whatâ€™s happening now, and respond to emerging conditions through automated actions.

## flowthings.io

> flowthings.io empowers any developer or organization to leverage the growing instrumentation of the physical world (aka, the Internet of Things) in order to build solutions that surprise with their intelligence, contextual awareness, and effectiveness in operations and user experiences.

## Internet of Things Workbench

> IBM Internet of Things Workbench is a service for designing, constructing and simulating Internet of Things systems consisting of devices, cloud services and clients. At this point it is provided as an experimental service which focuses on visual design using diagrams and rapid simulation of multiple devices over IBM Internet of Things Foundation as well as generic message brokers such as IBM Message Sight. Internet of Things Workbench generates Node.js and Node-RED application for the cloud services (applications) on top of IBM Bluemix, as well as simulated devices and clients using Javascript.
